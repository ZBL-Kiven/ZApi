 *
 * @param case It always coexists with [httpException], some errors are non-HttpException,
 * I have generated a unified HttpException based on it,
 * but for better extensibility (such as implementing a custom CallAdapterFactory and need to throw an exception for easy identification when using case),
 * it will work better than HttpException.
